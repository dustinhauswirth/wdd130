    <p> Hello Everyone, my name is Dustin Hauswirth. I am Married to my lovely wife Emma. 
        We got married at the peak of covid and had 5 people at our wedding. It was very 
        affordable.</p>
        <p>I love the opprotunity we have to go to school online at BYUi. It gives me the 
        chance to get an education at the speed my work and family life allow. It's been a 
        long time since I last went to school, so I'm grateful the pathway program refreshed a 
        lot of the things I learned in High school.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I would like to share that my wife Emma is pregnant with our first child! I am very excited 
            to be a father. I pray often that Heavenly Father will guide me to be like him for my children. I love my wife Emma so much.
        </p>
